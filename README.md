 A Stopwatch web application,
 I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implementing functions for starting, pausing, and resetting the stopwatch, as well as tracking and displaying lap times,
 users can accurately measure and record time intervals.
 In this way I create an interactive and user-friendly stopwatch web application.
